<h2>Best Time to Visit Helsinki</h2>
<p>Choosing the right time to visit Helsinki can significantly enhance your travel experience. The city offers distinct charms throughout the year, influenced by weather, local events, and tourist traffic.</p>
<h3>Weather Considerations</h3>
<p>Helsinki experiences four distinct seasons, each with its own character. Summers (June to August) are mild and pleasant, with temperatures ranging from 15°C to 25°C (59°F to 77°F). This is the ideal time for outdoor activities, festivals, and exploring the archipelago.</p>
